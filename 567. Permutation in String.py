        LeetCode: 567. Permutation in String
        Pattern: Brute-force window with frequency counts (no code changes, comments only)

        Goal: Return True if any permutation of s1 is a substring of s2.

        Approach in this implementation:
        - Build a frequency map (counter) for s1.
        - Slide a window of size len(s1) across s2.
        - For each window, build its frequency map (temp) and compare with counter.
        - If for every character the counts in the window are sufficient, return True.
        - This is a brute-force approach and has a time complexity of O(n * k) where n = len(s2), k = len(s1), as we rebuild the frequency map for each window.
        - another appprach for this is we just keep removing feq from our first map and if we see that there is no freq remaining we can return true

        Time:  O(n * k) where n = len(s2), k = len(s1) (rebuilds temp per window)
        Space: O(Î£) for frequency maps
